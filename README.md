# Horiseon landing page

## Description

This is my take on the Horiseon landing page code refactor for the EdX frontend web developer bootcamp - module 1. This project has introduced me to a new concept within web development and that is "code refactor". 

In this project, I took an outdated version of a landing page and brought into this century by adding semantic tags within the HTML for accessibility and to improve SEO. Combined elements within the CSS to make the code easier to read for other developers and to stop unnecessary repetition. Included detailed comments throughout both the HTML & CSS so other developers know what they're looking at. And finally, I finished off by making the sure landing page works as intended. That all links direct to where they're supposed too, all images contain an attribute that describes the image itself and that everything is supposed to be sitting where it was intented too.

I think the best part of this project is that it's opened my eyes to a new concept within web developement. Going through someones previous work and bringing that piece of work up to date with latest standards within the industry. I had no idea that "code refactoring" was a thing before I started this.
